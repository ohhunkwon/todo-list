# to-do list app

Created using HTML, CSS, JS

In this front-end project, in addition to practising fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I learnt to use basic features of a module bundler - webpack, and the Web Storage API mechanism - localStorage.

On reflection, I believe I need to put into practice a more cleaner code architecture by sticking to SOLID principles, by organising my code into even smaller and modular files that can all logically fit together.
